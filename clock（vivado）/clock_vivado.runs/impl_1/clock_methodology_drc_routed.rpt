2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u2/temp[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u6/temp_reg[0]/CLR, u6/temp_reg[1]/CLR, u6/temp_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
